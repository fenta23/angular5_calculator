### Fuse-box + Angular 5 + Material.io

### Angular 5 Boilerplate

Just my own little boilerplate.
* Material.io ('https://material.angular.io/')
* Removed covernant, don't need this
* Angular 5.2.3


* Based on the original Angular 2 Demo Seed: 'https://github.com/fuse-box/angular2-example'



The application uses HOT module reload approach to keep your browser window in sync. 
You will get instant CSS updates as well.

* FuseBox takes care of es6 modules used in angular

#### Setup & run
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* `npm dist`: build production
* `npm test`: run tests
* `npm test:auto`: run tests and watch files to re run tests
